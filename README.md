# DL-with-Python-book-Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks to use while reading "Deep Learning with Python" book

`Note` - All the notesbook in this repository are forked from original authors [repository](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks). I have modified some of the code and content in the notebooks to run with Keras 2.4.3

These notebooks use Python 3.6 and Keras 2.4.3 

## Table of contents

* Chapter 2:
    * [2.1: A first look at a neural network]
